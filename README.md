## Usage

### Getting Started

1. **Launch the Application**: Open ExcaliApp from your applications folder or run the executable

2. **Select a Directory**:
   - On first launch, you'll be prompted to select a folder containing your Excalidraw files
   - The app remembers your last selected directory for future sessions
   - Use `File → Open Directory` (Ctrl/Cmd+O) to change directories anytime

3. **Create or Edit Files**:
   - Click "New File" or use `File → New File` (Ctrl/Cmd+N) to create a new drawing
   - Click any file in the sidebar to open it for editing
   - Your changes are automatically saved every 30 seconds

4. **Navigate Between Files**:
   - Use the tree view sidebar to browse your file structure
   - Click on folders to expand/collapse them
   - Files are sorted with folders first, then alphabetically

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Action         | Windows/Linux | macOS       |

### Technology Stack

- **Desktop Framework**: [Tauri 2.x](https://tauri.app/) - Rust-based framework for building native desktop apps
- **Frontend Framework**: [React 19](https://react.dev/) with TypeScript
- **Drawing Engine**: [@excalidraw/excalidraw](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw)
- **Build Tool**: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- **UI Components**: [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **State Management**: React hooks with local storage persistence

### Security Features

- **Path Traversal Protection**: All file paths are validated and canonicalized
- **File Type Validation**: Only `.excalidraw` files can be read/written
- **Content Validation**: JSON structure is validated before saving
- **Sandboxed File Access**: Tauri's security model restricts file system access
